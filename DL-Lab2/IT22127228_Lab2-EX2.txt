1.What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?
As there are more hidden nodes, the neural network can learn complex decision boundaries more effectively. As there are very few nodes, like one or two, the model is too simple and underfits the data so much that the accuracy is low. As the number of nodes increases to the range of three or five, the model has enough capacity to learn patterns in the dataset, and the accuracy is high. However, when the number of hidden nodes is increased further, say to twenty or fifty, the accuracy no longer increases and still remains at the same level, which suggests that any further complexity is not adding anything extra to this dataset.


2.Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?
The precision has a definite trend with an increase in the number of hidden nodes. Initially, with hardly any nodes, the model is not performing well due to its inability to grasp the complexity of the data. As nodes are increased, the performance cuts sharply as the network can express more intricate relationships. When the ideal number of nodes is reached, the accuracy stabilizes and does not improve any further even if additional hidden nodes are added. This plateau indicates that the model has gained sufficient capacity to learn the issue, and only increased cost is attached to computation without the outcomes being improved.
